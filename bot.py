# ToDo
#	try and fix spacing some issues in scentences
# done
#	work in @ replies (Streaming api?)
# 	make a psuedo randomizer for each time it runs to make it not run every hour
# 	make apsuedo randomizer for images?
#	pick a random start date in the twitter timeline to avoid too many like tweets
#	make a simple flask face for heroku
